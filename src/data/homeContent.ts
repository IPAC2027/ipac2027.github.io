      message: "We are delighted to welcome you to IPAC’27 in Detroit, Michigan. Over the past decade, Detroit has been experiencing an extraordinary revival, from its renowned industrial legacy to today’s creativity, innovation, and energy. Every year, around 8.7 million people visit downtown Detroit, drawn by its revitalized waterfront and world-class venues. \n\n The world around us is changing rapidly. Environments continue to evolve in ways that are often hard to predict. Yet as scientists and engineers, we instinctively look for what remains unchanged and search for invariants. I hope the IPAC community and the collaboration spirit behind it, can be on the top of our invariant list. \n\n So let us meet again in Detroit. Let us continue our conversations. Let us build new collaborations, and celebrate both changes and what remains constant. \n\n I look forward to seeing you at IPAC’27. ",
